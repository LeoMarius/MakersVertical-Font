Makers-Vertical-Font
====================

A font designed for FDM 3D printing.

Based on a Bitstream Vera Mono Font, the MakersVertical Font is designed to be used on 3D printed models using FDM printers (reprap, makerbot etc...) without support material.

The [Rev1] is designed for caracteres of minimum 4mm high and optimal at 8mm, using an 0.4mm printer noozle.

The goal is to build an parametric font depending of the wanted size, the printer noozle and the layers thickness.
